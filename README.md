# sharkmon-rs
Small monitor + embedded web server to monitor the Electro Industries Shark 100S

The EIG Shark 100S (and others in this family) have an integrated Ethernet/Wifi
TCP bridge for their Modbus access, but do not have an easy-to-view web server
to surface the data available.

This small rust program does what you'd think: Connects to the Shark, reads its
modbus information once per second, and makes the averaged data on watts,
volts, and frequency available as a simple web page suitable for
displaying on an iPad as a power monitor.

Visit http://localhost:8081/ to see the page, or
http://localhost:8081/power to see a JSON summary of the power data.

Use:

```
   cargo build --release
   ./target/release/sharkmon
```

Note that sharkmon expects the file "sharkmon.html" to be in the same directory from which you run it.
